  <div id="article_text">
    <p>It's been a very challenging week for me and I just wanted to escape from 
it all. Life hasn't really been treating me well. The new job didn't quite 
turned out what I wanted to do after all, I had a fight with my 
girlfriend, my parents are having all sorts of domestic issues. Oh man!</p>
<p>Good thing its the weekend and I can finally get some peace and quiet by 
the willow tree in the nearby hills. I really like hanging out here. It 
really relaxes my mind and I can be calm and still.</p>
<h2>a strange happening</h2>
<p>I was just about to fall a sleep when a some kind of portal appeared a few 
meters in front of me. There was a bright light and in an instant the 
portal disappeared. </p>
<p>I then saw something glimmer and then there was a loud <em>"thud"</em>. Walking 
towards the sound, I saw a cross with a circle on top of it. People call 
this an <em>"Ankh"</em>. I heard the Egyptians thinks of it as a symbol of life. 
Right beside it are a couple of books wrapped in cloth which resembles a 
map with strange writings on it. One of the books is a history book and 
the other one is a strange looking book about magic.</p>
<p>Somehow, I am compelled to read the history book. So I browsed over it, 
but shortly decided to put it away for now. </p>
<h2>beyond the hills</h2>
<p>Suddenly I heard a mix of merry music and laughter behind a nearby hill. 
I was attracted to it. As I was approaching the source of the sound, I was 
welcomed with a sight of a carnival. I'm pretty sure there's no carnival 
here before. Its all very strange indeed. </p>
<p>I continued walking towards the entrance. When the guard saw my Ankh he 
ushered me right in. I was then attracted to a strange music coming from a 
wagon. I walked straight for it, not minding the rest of the carnival. </p>
<p>Inside, I was met by a Gypsy who's also wearing an Ankh. She mentioned 
something about they've been waiting for me. She then told me that its 
time to reveal my destiny. I feel very strange and creeped out right now 
but I'm somehow curious to know what is she talking about. So I decided to 
play along.</p>
<h2>going spiral</h2>
<p>She brought out some cards and an abacus-like object minus the beads and 
begun asking me situational questions depending on the card the she 
picked. </p>
<p>I answered them honestly and once the final question was answered, the 
Gypsy said that my path is set. Suddenly, I started feeling very dizzy. 
Everything around me suddenly turned spiral. Before I lost consciousness, 
I heard the Gypsy told me to seek out the King to find out what my mission 
is. </p>
<h2>the journey begins</h2>
<p>When I regained my consciousness, I found myself lying on the ground with 
staff on my hand. The Ankh is around my neck and the map and books were 
right beside me. I'm also wearing a brownish robe and tunic, just like the 
shepherds I see in pictures. </p>
<p>The land around me is very strange and seems dangerous. Suddenly I 
remembered the events that transpired before I got here. I'm supposed to 
find the King of this land. I remembered his name is Lord British. But how 
do I get there and where am I exactly?</p>
<p>As if my problems aren't big enough, now I'm stuck in some strange land 
with no clue on what's happening. I'm both terrified and strangely excited 
at the same time. </p>
<p>Terrified of what perils are in stored for me here yet excited by the 
smell of adventure and new discoveries. I've always been the curious, 
adventurous type after all!</p>
<p>I guess I better finish reading the history book to get some clues.</p>
<hr />
<h6>Notes</h6>
<p>In case you missed it, I actually got a Shepherd class character. I 
haven't played this class before and I'm quite excited to play him out. Oh 
and I named him <code>Eli</code>. It just seems like I've been quite fond of using 
that name for my characters lately. </p>
<p>Also, notice that I've decided to write the story in first-person POV for 
better immersion. </p>
<p>I think Ultima IV is one of those games where you really have to play out 
the role to get the most out of the game. Its not just about 
hack-and-slashing your way through the game or making the best character 
build or unlocking the next achievement or highscore. Its a genuine 
experience where the game doesn't hold your hand and leaves you in a 
massive world waiting for you to experience and discover its secrets and 
grandeur. </p>
<p>Lastly, be forewarned: There will be typos and grammatical errors!</p>

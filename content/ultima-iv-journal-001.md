It's been a very challenging week for me and I just wanted to escape from 
it all. Life hasn't really been treating me well. The new job didn't quite 
turned out what I wanted to do after all, I had a fight with my 
girlfriend, my parents are having all sorts of domestic issues. Oh man!

Good thing its the weekend and I can finally get some peace and quiet by 
the willow tree in the nearby hills. I really like hanging out here. It 
really relaxes my mind and I can be calm and still.


## a strange happening

I was just about to fall a sleep when a some kind of portal appeared a few 
meters in front of me. There was a bright light and in an instant the 
portal disappeared. 

I then saw something glimmer and then there was a loud *"thud"*. Walking 
towards the sound, I saw a cross with a circle on top of it. People call 
this an *"Ankh"*. I heard the Egyptians thinks of it as a symbol of life. 
Right beside it are a couple of books wrapped in cloth which resembles a 
map with strange writings on it. One of the books is a history book and 
the other one is a strange looking book about magic.

Somehow, I am compelled to read the history book. So I browsed over it, 
but shortly decided to put it away for now. 


## beyond the hills

Suddenly I heard a mix of merry music and laughter behind a nearby hill. 
I was attracted to it. As I was approaching the source of the sound, I was 
welcomed with a sight of a carnival. I'm pretty sure there's no carnival 
here before. Its all very strange indeed. 

I continued walking towards the entrance. When the guard saw my Ankh he 
ushered me right in. I was then attracted to a strange music coming from a 
wagon. I walked straight for it, not minding the rest of the carnival. 

Inside, I was met by a Gypsy who's also wearing an Ankh. She mentioned 
something about they've been waiting for me. She then told me that its 
time to reveal my destiny. I feel very strange and creeped out right now 
but I'm somehow curious to know what is she talking about. So I decided to 
play along.


## going spiral

She brought out some cards and an abacus-like object minus the beads and 
begun asking me situational questions depending on the card the she 
picked. 

I answered them honestly and once the final question was answered, the 
Gypsy said that my path is set. Suddenly, I started feeling very dizzy. 
Everything around me suddenly turned spiral. Before I lost consciousness, 
I heard the Gypsy told me to seek out the King to find out what my mission 
is. 


## the journey begins

When I regained my consciousness, I found myself lying on the ground with 
staff on my hand. The Ankh is around my neck and the map and books were 
right beside me. I'm also wearing a brownish robe and tunic, just like the 
shepherds I see in pictures. 

The land around me is very strange and seems dangerous. Suddenly I 
remembered the events that transpired before I got here. I'm supposed to 
find the King of this land. I remembered his name is Lord British. But how 
do I get there and where am I exactly?

As if my problems aren't big enough, now I'm stuck in some strange land 
with no clue on what's happening. I'm both terrified and strangely excited 
at the same time. 

Terrified of what perils are in stored for me here yet excited by the 
smell of adventure and new discoveries. I've always been the curious, 
adventurous type after all!

I guess I better finish reading the history book to get some clues.
